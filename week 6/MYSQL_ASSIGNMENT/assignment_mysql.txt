ANS 1.    Database is a collection of data in an efficient manner which helps in mangaing, retrieving and manuplating data easily.
          Database allow to create ,insert,delete,retrive ,edit data inside database.

          Database is of two types SQL and Nosql

          Sql database is a structured database where data is stored in tables
          whereas Nosql(not only sql) is used to unstructured or semi structured data in the formate of key-value pairs or json type formate

          Sql is used when the data is uniform and structured means where each record to be stored has same types of attributes
          while Nosql database is used when data is unstructured or semistructured where each record ,ay have different attributes

          Sql is used where queries are complex and require multiple tables and relationship
          while Nosql database is used where data is dynamic and require scalability

          Sql databases example: mysql,oracle
          Nosql database example: mongodb, cassandra



ANS 2.   DDL stands for Data Defination Language which is used to define and create objects of database. It is subset 
         sql. It is used for create,delete,edit objects of database
         CREATE: It is used to create database and database oblects like TABLE
         ALTER : It is uded to modify, create,delte the structure of database objects
         DROP : It is used to delte existing database objects like TABLE
         TRUNCATE: It is used to fastly delete all the records from the table while keeping the structure of table intact
        
        
        
         CREATE TABLE Details(  
         NAME VARCHAR(50),
         ROLLNO INT
    
            );  --ANSWER 2

         INSERT INTO Details(NAME,ROLLNO)
         VALUES('Sneha Vasishth', 26),
         ('Akanksha Vasishth',10);

         CREATE TABLE Marks(NAME VARCHAR(50),ROLLNO INT, MATHS INT, COMPUTER INT);

         DROP TABLE Marks; --ANSWER 2

         ALTER TABLE `Details`
         ADD EMAIL VARCHAR(100); --ANSWER 2

         TRUNCATE TABLE Details; --ANSWER 2






ANS 3.   DML stand for data maipulation language which is the subset of sql. DML is used for manipulating the data stored in database. 
         It conist of INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE commands



         INSERT INTO Details(NAME,ROLLNO,EMAIL)
         VALUES('Sneha Vasishth',26,'snehasjkj@gmail.com'),
         ('Khushi',23,'khushijjjs@gmail.com');--ANSWER 3

         UPDATE `Details`
         SET NAME = 'Aashi'
         WHERE NAME= 'Sneha Vasishth'; -- Answer 3



         DELETE FROM Details
         WHERE ROLLNO = 23;




ANS 4.   DQL stands for data query language which is a subset of SQL
         It is mainly used for quering and fetching data from database.
         For this purpose we use SELECT commands

         

         SELECT NAME
         FROM `Details`
         WHERE ROLLNO= 26;-- ANSWER 4



ANS 5.   Primary key is a columns whose value is unique for all records.
         Primary key column contains non-null values acorss all records or row.
         Primary key column hepls to uniquely identify a paticular record.

         Foreign key is a column which is used to establish relationship with other tables. 
         It represnts relationship between tables  usually indicatin that the value of foreign key value 
         column of one table corresponds to values of primary key columns of another TABLE



ANS 6.   cursor()- It is a method which acts like pointer to connect python to our sql DATABASE
                   It helps to manage and execute sql commands

         execute()- Inside execute we write the sql command which we want python to execute through CURSOR



         (Example is given in demo.py)




ANS 7.   The order of execution of SQL clauses in a SQL query generally follows these steps:

FROM: Specifies the tableS from which data is retrieved.
JOIN: Joins additional tables together based on specified conditions. 
WHERE: Filters the rows based on specified conditions. 

GROUP BY: Groups rows that have the same values in specified columns. 

HAVING: Filters the results of GROUP BY based on specified conditions. It restricts the grouped data that will be included in the output.

SELECT: Specifies the columns to be retrieved. 

DISTINCT: Removes duplicate rows from the result set.

ORDER BY: Sorts the result set based on specified columns and sorting directions.
LIMIT : Used to limit the number of rows returned .
