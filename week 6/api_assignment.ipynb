    "ADVANTAGES:\n",
    "1. Code usability: It enables to use alreaady built software within our own software\n",

    "2. Rapid development: Since it allow to use other already built software thus we don't have to make everything of our own\n",

    "3. Innovation: API enables us to integrate different service and softwares in an efficient manner to make something valuable\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "DISADVANTAGE:\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. dependency: while using tird party api we become totally deendent upon them for stability and availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. security: poorly designed api become responsible for data braeches.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. limited customisation\n",
